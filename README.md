# PROJECT UPDATES

## TL; DR

Commits should be logical, atomic usnits of change that only empass one task or one fixt whose purpose can be clearly desribed in the commit message. 

## Issues Log
An issues log track bugs, improvements, feature requests and planned updates. 

Changes made to repository files myst be put into the project issues log first. Issue Log ID values are used in the Branch Name to allow reference back to a more detailed explanation of the requirement for making the commit.

| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (i.e. changing code for performance improvement or convenience purposes like readability)                                      |
| chore    | Style changes (changes that do not affect the meaning of the code: white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc), creating or updating documentation, adding or updating tests etc.  |
